Student-Information-System-with-File-Handling

this is a file-based Student Information System, a program designed to manage student records using a file for permanent data storage. It offers core functionalities to add, update, and delete student records, while also allowing you to display a list of all students. The program's ability to read and write data ensures that information is not lost when the application is closed. Furthermore, it is built with specific error handling to provide a smooth user experience by preventing issues like duplicate student IDs, invalid user input, or problems with file access.

My primary struggle is data management and persistence, as it requires implementing the logic to save the student records from memory to a file and correctly load them back, while handling potential file-related errors like a FileNotFoundError. Another significant hurdle is building a robust program flow and user interface, which involves creating a continuous loop for the main menu and ensuring the program responds correctly to user selections. Finally, making the system reliable requires thorough error handling to validate user input, prevent duplicate student IDs, and manage instances where a student record isn't found, ensuring the program doesn't crash from common mistakes.
